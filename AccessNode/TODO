- (M) Compress History data (check it is possible).
- (H) Store history data in multiple files to avoid slow one file handling.
- (H) RA put file currently block any activity for some time on large files.
TRY: use multiple writes (multiple of block size) instead on one large write.
- (M) Use dispatch parameter on commands, to allow LG commands to mesh and 1xx 
simultaneously.
- (M) Move all cc_comm functionality to CommMgr
- (L) Integrate rf into CommMgr?
- (A) Use mesh for YSI
- (H) Third path for comands and responses: 
	commands from  RA, SM, local 
	responses to HM, CC, local.
This way, instead of customizing NC, we will customize add_dnc_command.
- (M) pipes header change the meaning of next fields : 
		- MsgType 	- now means FROM 
		- MsgId - from events to be -1 ( now -1,-2,-3 ... )
		- new field FROM <- the current msg_type
